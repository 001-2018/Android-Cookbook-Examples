Arrh, Billy! Beware! The code here be taken from many different projects...

The main code is from the "Sliding Drawer - Top Down" recipe contributed by Wagied Davids
to the Android Cookbook.

I have been putting this project back together, given that Wagied didn't give us all the pieces
and is apparently not able to at present.

Some of the graphic elements were taken from the http://smart-timetable.googlecode.com/
"Smart Timetable" googlecode project, and are copyright, and ASL-2 licensed, by Google Inc.

The Panel class is missing, but I'm committing this in case anybody can finish it.
