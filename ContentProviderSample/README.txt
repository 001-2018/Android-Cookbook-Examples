This is an attempt to build the skeletal ContentProvider info from 
http://androidcookbook.com/Recipe.seam?recipeId=1558
into a compilable, complete, working program.

The UI was provided by the Android New Project wizard by
selecting "List-Detail" for the type of application.

STATUS - 
	INCOMPLETE    NOT WORKING
	But at least it compiles, so it's a good starting point.
	
	Only committed in this state b/c I had to change computers to keep working on it.
