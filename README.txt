This will contain the source code examples from the recipes published in the O'Reilly Android Cookbook (see http://androidcookbook.com/). Not all recipes have code; this features code that was either linked by the contributor, or in a few cases, re-constructed as a New Project by the editor, for your convenience.

Each Directory is its own Eclipse project. If you open the repo in Eclipse with eGit, be sure to check the
    "create all projects"
checkbox.

There is neither a Wiki or a Tracker for this project, since bugs and suggestions should be made on the Android Cookbook web site (http://androidcookbook.com/).
