This repo contains most of the source code examples from the recipes published in the O'Reilly Android Cookbook (see http://androidcookbook.com/). Not all recipes have code; this repo features code that was either linked by the contributor, or in a few cases, re-constructed as a New Project by the editor, for your convenience. And of course some projects used as examples in the book are routinely hosted elsewhere.

Each Directory comprises its own Eclipse project, and has a name that is cited at the end of the corresponding Recipe, under the "Source Code Download" section. If you open the repo in Eclipse with eGit, be sure to check the
    "create all projects"
checkbox.

Many of the projects will give you some noise when you first open them due to bin and/or gen being missing. The Eclipse plug-in will usually create them but not notify that it's done so, meaning you just have to do Refresh (F5), failing that, close and re-open the project. There is a workaround but I haven't had time to apply it to all projects yet (creating empty directories).

There is neither a Wiki or a Tracker for this project, since bugs and suggestions about the code should be made on the Android Cookbook web site (http://androidcookbook.com/).
