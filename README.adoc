== Android Cookbook Examples

This repo contains over a hundred source code examples from the recipes published in 
http://androidcookbook.com/[the O'Reilly Android Cookbook], a great source 
of tutorial material for the Android Developer. Not all recipes in the book or online have code
accompanying them; this repo features code that was either linked by the
contributor, or in several cases, re-constructed as a New Project by the
editor for your convenience.

Further note that not all programs used in the book/online appear here; some
of the examples in the book/online are only program fragments taken from
other programs that can't be included. And of course some code is drawn from existing projects
that are hosted elsewhere.

Each Directory comprises its own project, and has a name that is cited at the end of the corresponding Recipe, under the "Source Code Download" section. 

*NOTE* As of today, there are two styles of projects:

. Eclipse projects with the newer Eclipse Andmore;
. Android Studio projects (most complete with their extraneous "app" subdirectory).

If you have used the old Google ADT, you will need to update your Eclipse config by *removing* ADT,
then replace it with AndMore from the Eclipse Marketplace Client.

Most of the Eclipse projects have been Mavenized; a few have not.

Most of the Gradle projects will also build with Android Studio; a few will not.

The table <<table>> shows which projects are set up for which build tools.

=== TL;DR: Build Most Projects with Apache Maven

Prerequisites: Java 7 SDK **including "Google Repository" for compat stuff**, $$git$$, _Maven_

. git clone https://github.com/mosabua/maven-android-sdk-deployer
. cd maven-android-sdk-deployer
. mvn install -P 6.0 # at least
. mvn install -P 7.0 # after it's released!
. cd ..
. git clone https://github.com/IanDarwin/Android-Cookbook-Examples
. cd Android-Cookbook-Examples
. $$mvn -fae package android:install android:run$$
Include $$android:install$$ and $$android:run$$ only if you actually want to run them all, and have a device or emulator with some good free space; else just do 'package')
. Fix up any that didn't work, and send pull requests!

=== Maven Build: More Details

Most of these projects were initially developed using Eclipse ADT, and migrated to Maven for automatic building.
Obviously the Googlezilla has spoken and we will eventually have to migrate kicking and screaming to Android Studio and Gradle; pull requests for this would also be welcomed, _as long as they don't break support for Eclipse and Maven_.

If you open the entire repo in Eclipse with eGit, be sure to check the `Import all projects`
checkbox. If you want to keep these mini-projects separate from your "regular" work, you may want to use the Git repo as an Eclipse workspace (use File->Switch Workspace->Other->Browse). 
This directory is already set up to be an Eclipse workspace if you want it to
(the __.metadata__ directory exists and is already in __.gitignore__).

*Note*: As part of the move to Gradle, Google stopped pushing Android releases to Maven Central; their last version
was 4.1.1.4, thus Lollipop, Marshmallow, and "N" have been left high-and-dry. 
And worse, their SDK license prohibits re-distribution of binaries, so nobody else can step in
and upload these files to Maven Central. But of course there is a solution.
To compile these projects with Maven you will need to download the amazing maven-android-sdk-deployer, which repackages
files from the SDK - after you download it using the Android tools, thus nobody is redistributing it - 
into your _local_ ++.m2/repository++ so that Maven can find it.
This is the function of the first few steps in the numbered list above.

Note that projects using official releases use e.g. com.google.android:android:4.1.1.4 whereas projects deployed
using the sdk-deployer use e.g android:android:6.0_r3.

You can download AndroidCookbookExamples as a Zip file from GitHub, but then you won't get updates, and it will be hard to collaborate with the other contributors. If you're not familiar with Git and Github, see 
https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/[the getting started page on GitHub] and read up on how to collaborate. You can either send diff/patch files or send a pull request.  Remember that GitHub is a free service for public projects!

Many of the projects may (depending on your version of Eclipse) give you some noise when you first open them due to bin and/or gen being missing. The Eclipse plug-in will usually create them but not notify that it's done so, meaning you just have to do Refresh (F5), failing that, close and re-open the project. Does not happen with current Eclipse, last I tried.

There is neither a Wiki or a Tracker for this project, since bugs and suggestions about the code should be made on the Android Cookbook web site (http://androidcookbook.com/). Bugs or suggesions on the published edition of the book should go to http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920010241.do; you can also purchase the book there (which helps fund my continued work on this code base).

=== You can't build the whole mess with Gradle

You can't have this pretty thing. Because Gradle. Because Android Studio. Because fail.

Patches welcome if they don't break any existing builds (Maven, Eclipse) AND if you can still open
each individual project without Studio going ape-**** and opening every other existing project
as a "module" of the one you're trying to build.
Watch for my forthcoming paper "Gradle and Android Studio Considered Harmful."

=== Notes for the First Edition of the book

The current version of this repo has been reorganized in preparation for the second edition of the book.
There have been quite a few projects added since the first published edition of the book, and
a few renamed, so if you have the printed edition from 2012 you 
should rummage around here before re-typing anything that looks like a full example.

If you want this repo to correspond to the last minor revision of the first edition,
use git to checkout the tag `Book-1.0`.

=== DELETED PROJECTS

JpsTrack and the ToDo applications have graduated to their own github projects, up one level from here on Github.

=== Wishlist

There are some things I'd love it if people would contribute:

* Gradle files for each project that doesn't already have one (they almost all have Maven files now.
* Readme file for each project, to include a link back to the recipe in the online version of the book.

=== List of Projects

The following list is generated (periodically) from the project folders.
In the _Builds With_ column, *E* for Eclipse, *M* for Maven, *S* for Android Studio, *G* for Gradle.
