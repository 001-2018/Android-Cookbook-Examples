This project is the backend server for Razorback. It implements in
JavaEE (JAX-RS) both the web-service and the web UI parts of the
CHF server.  In the old Rails version, both parts run on different
ports (the REST service normally runs on port 8099). Here there is
no distinction, both run on port 80.

It needs an app server and a database. Developed with JBoss AS7
(now known as WildFly see http://wildfly.org) and PostgreSQL 9. For
JBoss AS7 setup, see files under jbossas7/.

The JPA model exported by datamodel-java is used to save the actual
data.

The service needs to be configured for BASIC AUTH on the PUT services.
